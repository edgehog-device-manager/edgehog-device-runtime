# Edgehog Device Runtime

[![CI](https://github.com/edgehog-device-manager/edgehog-device-runtime/actions/workflows/check.yaml/badge.svg?branch=main)](https://github.com/edgehog-device-manager/edgehog-device-runtime/actions/workflows/check.yaml?branch=master)
[![codecov](https://codecov.io/gh/edgehog-device-manager/edgehog-device-runtime/branch/main/graph/badge.svg)](https://app.codecov.io/gh/edgehog-device-manager)

Edgehog Device Runtime is a portable middleware written in [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/), that
enables remote device management using [Edgehog](https://github.com/edgehog-device-manager/edgehog).

## Supported Operating System

At the moment only Linux-based systems are supported.

See also [OS requirements](doc/os_requirements.md) for further information.

## Implemented Features

The following information are sent to remote Edgehog instance:

- OS info (data is read from `/etc/os-release`)
- Hardware info
- System status (data is read from proc filesystem)
- Runtime info and compiler version
- OTA update using RAUC
- `Edgehog Device Runtime` status changes via systemd.
- Network interface info
- Base image (data is read from `/etc/os-release`)
- Battery status data

## How it Works

Edgehog Device Runtime relies on [Astarte](https://github.com/astarte-platform/astarte) in order to
communicate with the remote Edgehog instance.

Edgehog Device Runtime is a reference implementation of
[Edgehog Astarte Interfaces](https://github.com/edgehog-device-manager/edgehog-astarte-interfaces).
Astarte interfaces describe how data are exchanged with the remote instance, and what kind of
features are implemented.

## Configuration

Edgehog Device Runtime can be configured using a [TOML](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TOML) file
located either in $PWD/edgehog-config.toml or /etc/edgehog/config.toml, or in a custom path, run
`cargo run -- --help` for more informations.

Example configuration:

```toml
credentials_secret = "YOUR_CREDENTIAL_SECRET"
device_id = "YOUR_UNIQUE_DEVIDE_ID"
pairing_url = "https://api.astarte.EXAMPLE.COM/pairing"
realm = "examplerealm"
interfaces_directory = "/usr/share/edgehog/astarte-interfaces/"
store_directory = "/var/lib/edgehog/"
download_directory = "/var/tmp/edgehog-updates/"
[[telemetry_config]]
interface_name = "io.edgehog.devicemanager.SystemStatus"
enabled = true
period = 60
```
